# yuno-sdk-android

## Android SDK Requirements

In order to use the Yuno Android SDK, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Yuno Android SDK needs your minSdkVersion to be of 21 or above.
- Your project must have Java 8 enabled and use AndroidX instead of older support libraries.
- The android-gradle-plugin version must be 4.0.0 or above.
- The Proguard version must be 6.2.2 or above.
- The kotlin-gradle-plugin version must be 1.4.0 or above.

## Adding the SDK to the project

First, add the repository source using the following code line:

```Gradle
maven { url "https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release" }
```

After that, include the code snippet below in the "build.gradle" file to add the Yuno SDK dependency
to the application.

```Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'
}
```

#### Permissions

We have already included the INTERNET permission by default as we need it to make network requests.

```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### Initialize Yuno

To initialize the Yuno SDK, first, you need to get your public API keys from the Yuno dashboard.
Then, if you have not implemented a custom application yet, you will need to create one and call the
initialize function in the onCreate() method of your application class.

The following code snippet includes an example of a custom application:

```kotlin
class CustomApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Yuno.initialize(
            this,
            "your api key",
            config: YunoConfig, // This is a data class to use custom configs in the SDK.
        )
    }
}
```

Please use the YunoConfig data class presented as follows:

```kotlin
data class YunoConfig(
    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP, // This is optional, CardFormType.ONE_STEP by default, this is to choose Payment and Enrollment Card flow.
    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false, // This is to choose if show save card checkbox on cards flows.
    val keepLoader: Boolean = false // This is to choose if keep Yuno loading screen until you create and continue with payment, this need an additional step that is shown below.
    val cardFormDeployed: Boolean = false, // This is only for SDK FULL, This is to choose if show card form deployed on payment methods list (TRUE) or if show normal card form in another screen (FALSE)
    val language: YunoLanguage? = null, //This is to choose the language of the SDK, if you send null or don't send it, Yuno SDK will take device language.
    val isDynamicViewEnabled: Boolean = false, //This is to choose if you want to use dynamic view or not, if you send false or don't send it, Yuno SDK will take false.
)
```

Available Languages

```kotlin
enum class YunoLanguage {
    SPANISH,
    ENGLISH,
    PORTUGUESE,
    INDONESIAN,
    MALAYSIAN
}
```

To keep Yuno loading screen until you create and continue with payment you also have to use the
function startCompletePaymentFlow() that is explained on the next session.

In addition, you need to update your manifest to use your application:

```XML

<application android:name=".CustomApplication"></application>
```

## Functions

### Enroll a new payment method

To start an enrollment flow is a must to call initEnrollment method on the onCreate method of your
activity, this because we use it to register the contract to give you the final enrollment state.

````Kotlin
fun ComponentActivity.initEnrollment(
    callbackEnrollmentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null, //Default null | To register this callback is a must to call ```initEnrollment``` method on the onCreate method of activity.
)
````

Call the following method from your activity to start an enrollment flow of a new payment method.

````Kotlin
fun Activity.startEnrollment(
    customerSession: String,
    countryCode: String,
    showEnrollmentStatus: Boolean = true, //Optional - Default true
    callbackEnrollmentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null, //Optional - You can send again another callback that is gonna override the one you sent on initEnrollment function.
)
````

### Callback Enrollment State

To register a callback to get the final enrollment state, it is necessary call the `initEnrollment`
method on the onCreate method of activity.

### Get Enrollment State

To only get the final enrollment state, it is necessary call the `initEnrollment`
method on the onCreate method of activity, in that method you register a callback function
called `callbackEnrollmentState`, we are gonna give you the status in that callback.

# IMPORTANT: This function is not gonna start the enrollment process, is only to check a previous enrollment state this based on customer session.

````Kotlin
fun AppCompatActivity.enrollmentStatus(
    customerSession: String,
    countryCode: String,
    showEnrollmentStatus: Boolean = false, //Optional - Default false
    callbackEnrollmentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null, //Optional - You can send again another callback that is gonna override the one you sent on initEnrollment function.
)
````

### Checkout

To start a new payment process, you need to call the following method on the onCreate method of
activity that calls the SDK:

```Kotlin
startCheckout(
    checkoutSession: "checkout_session",
countryCode: "country_code_iso",
callbackOTT: (String?) -> Unit,
callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,
merchantSessionId: String? = null //Optional - Default null 
)
```

#### Callback One Time Token (OTT)

The `callbackOTT` parameter is a function that returns an OTT needed to complete the payment back to
back. This function is mandatory.

#### Callback Payment State

The `callbackPaymentState` parameter is a function that returns the current payment process. Sending
this function is not mandatory if you do not need the result. The possible states are:

```Kotlin
const val PAYMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = "SUCCEEDED"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_FAIL = "FAIL"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = "PROCESSING"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_REJECT = "REJECT"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = "INTERNAL_ERROR"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = "CANCELED"
```

#### Show Payment Methods

When implementing the Full SDK version, you need to add the following view on your layout to show
the available payment methods:

```XML

<com.yuno.payments.features.payment.ui.views.PaymentMethodListView
    android:id="@+id/list_payment_methods" android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

#### Start Payment

To start a payment process, you have to call the method `startPayment`. However, if you are using
the lite version of the SDK, you must call the method `startPaymentLite`.

###### Full SDK Version

```Kotlin
startPayment(
    callbackOTT:(String?) -> Unit, //Optional - Default null,
showPaymentStatus: Boolean, //Optional - Default true
)
```

###### Lite SDK Version

```Kotlin
startPaymentLite(
    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,
    callbackOTT:(String?) -> Unit, //Optional - Default null,
showPaymentStatus: Boolean, //Optional - Default true
)
```

For the Lite version, you need to send an additional parameter, which is the vaulted token and/or
the payment type that the user selected to make the payment.

```Kotlin
PaymentSelected(
    id : String "payment_vaulted_token",
    type : String "payment_type",
)
```

At the end of this process, you will obtain the OTT, which is a required parameter to create a
payment via the Payments API POST/payments. You can obtain this data from to `onActivityResult`
explained in the callback section.

#### Complete Payment

If in the create_payment response the sdk_action_required parameter is true you need to call the
following method:

```Kotlin
continuePayment(
    showPaymentStatus: Boolean, //Optional - Default true
    callbackPaymentState:((String?) -> Unit)?, //Optional - Default null
)
```

To show your own payment status screens, you should send `false` in the `showPaymentStatus`
parameter and then get the payment state by callback.

###### Complete Flow To Keep Yuno Loader

if you want to keep Yuno loading screen, you have to send in YunoConfig parameter in
Yuno.initialize() function the parameter keepLoader in TRUE and also when you decide to start the
payment you have to use the following function:

```kotlin
startCompletePaymentFlow(
    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected? = null,
showPaymentStatus: Boolean = true,
createPaymentFun: (suspend(ott: String) -> Unit)? = null,
callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null,
callbackOTT: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null,
)
```

the "createPaymentFun" parameter is a suspend function where Yuno wait until you create the payment
back to back, once the payment its created you complete the suspend function and Yuno will continue
with the payment, if you decide to use this flow you don't need to call continuePayment()
anymore.

## Create your own card form flow

For this you must follow the following steps:

### First Step

Create a new layout resource file called ```screen_payment_card_form.xml``` to override the current
xml and implement your own design.

### Second Step

After creating ```screen_payment_card_form.xml```, you can use your own design while ensuring the
use of Yuno Secure Fields components. This is so that the Yuno SDK can retrieve credit card
information.
